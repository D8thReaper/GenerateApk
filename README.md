This is an implementation test project to generate APK within an android app. The projects used here are APKBuilder (https://github.com/TadeasKriz/apkbuilder) and ShrinkWrap-android (https://github.com/TadeasKriz/shrinkwrap-android) and the library used is shrinkwrap 1.1.1.jar (http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/s/Downloadshrinkwrapapi111jar.htm). The project is still work under progress but soon will be fully functional.
